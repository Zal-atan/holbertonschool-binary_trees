# This is a Readme for the Binary Tree Project
## In this project we will learning to work with Binary Trees to store information, and find it more quickly in C

## There are 19 tasks in this project


## **Task 0**
*Write a function that creates a binary tree node

## **Task 1**
*Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

## **Task 2**
*Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

## **Task 3**
*Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

## **Task 4**
*Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

## **Task 5**
*Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

## **Task 6**
*Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

## **Task 7**
*Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

## **Task 8**
*Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

## **Task 9**
*Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

## **Task 10**
*Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

## **Task 11**
*Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

## **Task 12**
*Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

## **Task 13**
*Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

## **Task 14**
*Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree

## **Task 15**
*Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full

## **Task 16**
